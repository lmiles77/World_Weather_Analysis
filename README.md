## Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

This project was a welcome change of pace. I had never worked with API's before, so I was a little concerned about how difficult it might be to set up and utilize. Luckilym the module and challenge went better than I had anticipated. I enjoted learning how to pull random latitudes and longitudes and working with different datasets. I enjoyed learning how to create the various maps and how to add the heat and marker layers to map using the clean_hotels_df.
